CUSLayout
=========
<strong>CUSLayout for iOS managed positioning mechanism, the iOS SDK provides absolute positioning is very inconvenient to use, in addition to the emergence of 4-inch screen of the iPhone and iPad to make iOS developer need to spend more time in the layout, however iOS6.0 AutoLayout the mechanism is disappointing, I refer to Android, SWT, Swing layout mechanism, the preparation of for iOS CUSLayout, use CUSLayout has the following advantages:</strong><br>- Simplify coding, you do not need to take into account the pixel level, only for regional programming, which greatly improves the efficiency of programming<br>- Good readability, layout type can be a preliminary understanding of layout intent and child controls roughly placed, eliminating the need for a very tedious restore coordinate steps<br>- When the the UIView container Flip, size change, supporting multiple resolutions, automatic processing<br>- UIView category which makes it easy to create layout constraints in old code<br>- The API is simple and easy-to-use, low cost learning through the sample program to preliminary master<br>

How To Get Started
====================================
###Use static library
- 1.Open your existing project (or create a new one)
- 2.Drag and drop the CUSLayoutExample.xcodeproj file downloaded from github previously from Finder to your project (either root or under Frameworks)

- 3.In YOUR project configuration:<br>
in the Build Phases, Add CUSLayout (the lib, not the example app) as a Target Dependency<br>
in the Link Binary With Libraries section, add the libCUSLayout.a library<br>
- 4.In YOUR Prefix.pch file, add:

    \#import “CUSLayout.h”

- 5.In YOUR project configuration, on the “Build Settings” tab

- locate the “User Header Search Paths” setting, and set the Release value to "${PROJECT_DIR}/CUSLayout" (including quotes!) and check the “Recursive” check box.
- The Debug value should already be set, but if it’s not, change that as well.
- Also locate the “Always Search User Paths” value and set it to YES.
- Finally, find the “Other Linker Flags” option, and add the value -ObjC (no quotes).

### Installation with CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries like CUSLayout in your projects. See the ["Getting Started" guide for more information](https://github.com/JJMM/CUSLayout/wiki/Getting-Started-with-CUSLayout).

#### Podfile

```ruby
platform:ios
pod "CUSLayout"
```
